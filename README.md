# Feedback Management System

An application developed to benchmark the colleges on the bases of opinions of students. 
This application aims to provide the concerned authorities managing the education in our country to have an unbiased data of feedback of students which may help in a more reliable ranking of government and private colleges across the country and also highlights the key positive and negative aspects of every college.


## About The Project
Technical stack used in our application:

Backend-
NodeJS,
Express,
MongoDB and 
AWS

Frontend- HTML, CSS, Javascript, ReactJS and Firbase

Dependancies- Firebase, Google APIs, Mongoose ODM, Amazon Web Services

## Running and Testing
After installing required packages using the 'npm i' command, In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` (common in both frontend and backend)

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### NOTE 
The deployed version of backend is not very reliable. So in case of a failure, you may run the local backend setup first for the testing purpose.
And also since our idea depends upon validating a college representative based on several factors and parameters before they are authorized for moderating feedback support, it can't be done in the time contrained. So instead we are providing with the credentials of a dummy authourized representative for the sake of research and testing.
Credentials are as follows:- 
`email`: fcam@msijanakpuri.com
`password`: 123456
